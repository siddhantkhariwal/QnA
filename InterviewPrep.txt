Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

Characteristics of OOP:

More emphasis on data rather than functions
Divides the program into no of objects
Basic elements of OOP:

Class: It is a group of similar types of Objects which possess same attributes and behaviour.
Object: It is a unique entity that contains data and functions (characteristics and behaviour) together in an OOP.
Data Abstraction : Act of representing essential features without including the background details
Encapsulation : The wrapping of data and functions, together in a single unit.
Data Hiding : The data which cannot be accessed directly outside class premise, although they are in same class
Dynamic Binding : The process of linking function call to function signature
Inheritance : Property by which object of one class acquire some common properties of another class
Polymorphism : The process of using a function for more than one purpose.

JDK
The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides a software development environment  used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java  Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler  (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and  other tools needed in Java development.

JVM: A Java virtual machine is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.
